<p>About Me
<p>My first serious projects in software development began in 2011 with
    MSSQL Server 2009R2/2012, building ETL packages and pipelines in SSIS,
     building business intelligence reports using SSRS, debug SQL stored 
     procedures using SQL jobs, applied database normalization and optimization
      techniques in a star scheme for OLAP, as well as building MDX queries to 
      extract data from SSAS cube. In 2013 I attended MassBay Community College
       courses in Bio Informatics, then returned to study STEM full time at 
       Dutchess Community College in Poughkeepsie, NY January 2013-May 2015 
       where I graduated with an Associates in General Science, by 2015 have
        earned 60+ credits in STEM. In 2015, at DCC I double-majored in Computer
         Information Systems(CIS) and General Science(LAX) and was accepted to
          State University of NY, New Paltz with more than 80 credits, having
           never attended due to family related issues.</p>
<p>In 2016 I learned python and wanted to put these skills to the test and started 
	to build Django projects from several blogs and books. Django stuck with me because 
	of the comprehensive documentation. Now programming in Django and Python is my main career focus, 
	to become an expert in both.   </p>
